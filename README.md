RoboFriends is a web application developed as part of my journey in web development. 
This minimalist React.js project seamlessly integrates external APIsâ€”specifically, JSONPlaceholder for user information and RoboHash for user images.

## Core Features:
* API Integration: RoboFriends fetches user data from JSONPlaceholder and user images from RoboHash, ensuring an effective presentation of diverse information

* Responsive Design: RoboFriends is responsive adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes, including tablets and phones. The user interface remains consistent and intuitive across all platforms.
* Search Functionality: The application features a focused search capability, allowing users to efficiently filter robot cards by name. The fixed search bar ensures a persistent and accessible search experience.
* Dynamic Card Rendering: Utilizing the create-react-app package, RoboFriends renders only the cards pertinent to the search content. The display adjusts dynamically based on screen width, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Technology Stack:
React.js: This project showcases my experience in React.js development, a versatile JavaScript library known for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces.
